        Shortly, you will be presented with a set of images. Please view each image
        carefully. While viewing the images, please do your best to express as fully as
        possible any expression of the emotion you feel while viewing the images.
        Remember that the person viewing you can only see your head and part of your
        upper torso and cannot hear you. It is important for the sake of this study that
        you do your best to communicate what you are feeling. So please do the best
        you can to behave in such a way that the person viewing you on a monitor will
        be able to guess what you are feeling while viewing the image.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Before each image, focus your attention on the ‘+’ in the middle of the screen.
        After viewing each set of images, you will be asked to rate the emotional
        reactions you had to the images.
